# Basics/Recap

## Exercise 1: Build initialization

* Provide a Gradle Build for the project and its tests.
* Verify that the production code builds properly.
* Execute the tests and observe that there is a failing test that breaks the build. Fix or delete the failing test case and verify that the build succeeds.
  
## Exercise 2: Gradle update
* Cleanup your locally changed files (git diff/status) s.t. they meet _production-like quality standards_
  and create a (local) git commit containing these changes.
* Update your build to the most recent Gradle version (if you already used the latest version do a downgrade instead).
  Create a (local) git commit that contains the changes.
